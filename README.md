# Gold Tools Plus

## Description

The source code for a personal minecraft mod created using the fabric toolchain (https://fabricmc.net/) for 1.17.2.

The idea was to add an additional mineral to find via exploration (white gold). 
This would have similar properties to gold in that it would be a tool material with the fastest mining speed available.
In addition, edits were made to the vanilla minecraft codebase via mixins to allow for additional enchantment levels on both the white gold and normal gold tools.
This involved extensive reading of the decompiled minecraft source code in order to implement minimalistic edits that ensured as much compatibility with other mods as possible, while keeping vanilla functionality the same.

While the mod is playable, certain visual assets are not completly polished and integration with config libraries in order to read config files has not been achieved.
I do not feel comfortable releasing it in the psuedo-ready state that it is currently in, as while it is high enough quality for my own enjoyment, I hold public releases to a higher standard.
